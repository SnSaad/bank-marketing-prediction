Find the best strategies to improve for the next marketing campaign. How can the financial institution have a greater effectiveness for future marketing campaigns? In order to answer this, we have to analyze the last marketing campaign the bank performed and identify the patterns that will help us find conclusions in order to develop future strategies.

When considering features for a banking campaign, especially for predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service (e.g., a term deposit), you want to focus on features that are likely to have a significant impact on the outcome. Here's a brief explanation of each feature we mentioned and whether it should be considered:

Age: Age can be an important factor, as different age groups may have varying financial needs and preferences.

Job: The type of job can provide insights into a customer's income level and stability. It's often relevant for targeting specific customer segments.

Education: Education level can influence a person's financial literacy and their understanding of banking products. It may be relevant for targeting certain educational demographics.

Default: This binary feature indicates whether a customer has credit in default. It's crucial for risk assessment but may not be directly related to campaign success.

Housing: Whether a customer has a housing loan can be indicative of their financial situation and willingness to invest in additional financial products.

Loan: Similar to housing, whether a customer has a personal loan can provide insights into their financial situation.

Balance: The account balance is a crucial feature, as it directly reflects a customer's financial capacity and may influence their decision to invest.

Days: The number of days since the last contact can indicate recency, which is often important in marketing campaigns.

Duration: The duration of the last contact can be a significant predictor of campaign success, as longer conversations may indicate greater interest.

Campaign: The number of contacts made during the current campaign may affect a customer's receptiveness to the offer, but it's important not to over-contact customers.

Pdays: The number of days since the customer was last contacted may indicate the relevance of the current campaign.

Previous: The number of contacts made in previous campaigns can provide historical context and may influence campaign success.

Poutcome: The outcome of the previous marketing campaign can be a strong predictor of future success. If a customer responded positively before, they may be more likely to do so again.

In summary, the most relevant features for a banking campaign may include age, job, education, balance, duration, and previous campaign outcomes (poutcome). Features like default, housing, loan, and the number of days since last contact (days, pdays) can also be informative, depending on the specific goals of the campaign and the target audience. It's essential to perform data analysis and modeling to determine the actual predictive power of these features and to understand their relationships with the campaign outcome.
